If you've ever used Flutter and have gone through the process of creating a new Flutter Application Project, you're more than likely aware of what a skeleton app may look like. We've decided to create our own skeleton app here on teh @platform to make your 'Getting Started' experience that much smoother!

Our team is currently working very hard on this so be sure to check back later!

## Where should I go next?

We recommend checking out the demo apps that we have to offer! Reviewing these will greatly assist in your understanding of verb implementation on the @platform! It would also be a good idea to check out our @dev program which will show you how to have your app @certified and released to the market!

- [Sample Apps](/docs/sample-apps/): See apps that show off the power of the @platform on your own machine!

- [@dev Program](/dev_tools/): Read up on how to get your @certification and go to market with your privacy-focused application!
